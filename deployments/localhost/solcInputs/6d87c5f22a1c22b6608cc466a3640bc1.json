If your contract must store the response (or\r\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\r\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\r\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\r\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\r\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\r\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\r\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\r\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\r\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\r\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\r\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\r\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\r\n * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\r\n * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\r\n * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\r\n * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\r\n * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).\r\n */\r\nabstract contract VRFConsumerBaseV2 {\r\n  error OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill(address have, address want);\r\n  address public vrfCoordinator;\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract\r\n   */\r\n  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) {\r\n    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function setVRFCoordinator(address _vrfCoordinator) internal {\r\n    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function getVRFCoordinator() internal view returns (address) {\r\n    return vrfCoordinator;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.
